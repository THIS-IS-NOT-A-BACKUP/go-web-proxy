    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
    # Step 1: run a standard checkout action, provided by github
    - name: Checkout main
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
      with:
        ref: main
        # submodules: 'recursive'     ### may be needed in your situation
    # Step 2: run this sync action - specify the upstream repo, upstream branch to sync with, and target sync branch
    - name: Pull (Fast-Forward) upstream changes
      id: sync
      uses: aormsby/Fork-Sync-With-Upstream-action@v2.1
      with:
        upstream_repository: dabreadman/go-web-proxy
        upstream_branch: main
        target_branch: main
        git_pull_args: --allow-unrelated-histories                    # optional arg use, defaults to simple 'pull'
        github_token: ${{ env.GITHUB_TOKEN }}   # optional, for accessing repos that require authentication

    # Step 3: Display a message if 'sync' step had new commits (simple test)
    - name: Check for new commits
      if: steps.sync.outputs.has_new_commits
      run: echo "There were new commits."

    # Step 4: Print a helpful timestamp for your records (not required, just nice)
    - name: Timestamp
      run: date
